# DiscordGPT - ChatGPT inside your Discord server!

This project is a Discord chatbot that integrates OpenAI's GPT models to interact with users in a Discord channel. It allows for dynamic responses based on user input, leveraging OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities. The bot also supports updating its "personality" through a specific command, making it versatile in its interactions.
